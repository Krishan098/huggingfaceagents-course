# Llamaindex

## key components

- components: Are the basic building blocks you use in Llamaindex. These include things like prompts,models and databases. Components often help conect Llamaindex with other tools and libraries.
- Tools: Tools are components that provide specific capabilites like searching,calculating or accessing external services. 

- Agents: They are autonomous components that can use tools and make decisions. They coordinate tool usage to accomplish complex goals.

- Workflows: Are step-by-step processes that process logic together. Workflows or agentic workflows are a way to structure agentic behaviour without the explicit use of agents.

## Benefits

* clear workflow system: breaks down hoe agents should make decisions step by step using an event-driven and async-first syntax. This helps you clearly compose and organise your logic.

* Advanced Document parsing with LlamaPArse

* Many ready-to-use components

* LlamaHub
